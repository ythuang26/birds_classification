# Birds Classification - Predictive Modelling Competition

This is a group done by Ya Ting Huang, Alexandra Landry, Nastasia Kantsevitch, and Julius Alessandro Xanthoudakis. 

The goal of this project was to use the Bird Species dataset from Kaggle to test our skills in image classification.

## Instructions for the Project:
    
Make sure that your Training, Validation AND Test sets contain the same classes of species

Your test set is to be used at the very end -- to get a good sense of how your model is performing

You are expected to compile a CNN in order to correctly classify your selected 15 classes

Google Colab is your friend - it can help boost your model's training time

It can be beneficial to reshape some of the images to reduce some of the data - this will help speed up your model's training time

Do some research to find out ways to help boost your model's performance (i.e. data augmentation)

Make sure to save your model and during the presentation you will load your model and evaluate its performance on the validation set
